Step 1: CONTEXT

1. Education
2. On account of users are coming in and out often for class, there is some risk of a user forgetting to log out. If this were to happen and a different user got on the account, they could possibly log into some other accounts that are still logged in, in order to steal information from that user. FERPA could be at risk here as well if the user is still logged into myZou, because the attacker could easily access the user's grades.
